I do well as a team player with good leadership and communication skills - verbal and written. I am also a critical thinker who can attend to customer issues quickly and can consistently exceed performance standards. In addition, I am a calm individual with well Interpersonal personal relationship skills. I am very keen on making a good career for myself as a Data Analyst, Database administrator, and Technical support engineer. However, this skill (Data analysis) would play a pivotal role in achieving my set career goals.

# PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
Even though my Educational background has not been in an IT-related field, It was a data-driven course where we acquire data to analyze and detects anomalies in the subsurface. With this growing passion for numbers, I decided to diversify into Information Technology while upskilling and taking training on related courses online. With this, I have been certified as a Microsoft professional and Google IT support professional as well as a beneficiary of Access/Udacity Business Analysis.

I have a span of two years plus working as a Technical support engineer with a Top IT firm in Nigeria while advocating and supporting international end users to identify, troubleshoot and resolve IT-related issues. I have as part of my daily responsibilities showcased my technical and communication skills in order to resolve Windows Operating system, Mac Operating systems as well as Microsoft 365 applications issues.

We live in a data-driven world today and Data Analysis is simply used to drive better decision-making. The opportunity to be part of a decision-making process â€“ Data Analysis is one I am fully delighted about and when analysis reports are made by my superiors at the office.

I will be looking forward to a more technical role basically on Data analyzing, visualizing, and possibly other IT support roles that involve supporting software and applications where my skills and competencies would be in great use with a dynamic and reputable organization. I also want to be able to showcase my analytical, Problem solving, Interpersonal, technical, and fast-learning skills acquired during my educational and professional development to contribute to the growth of the organization.

# UDEMY DATA PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I was challenged with a situation where I happen to be a Data analyst, presenting the data for various Udemy courses. I am required to work with the Raw data and was able to clean, analyze and visualize the data to make business decisions.

I investigated Udemy data sets of subscribers trends in four (4) different subject areas. Using Google Sheets, the data was cleaned up of duplicates, blank cells were removed, and inconsistent data was corrected. To build the necessary charts and visuals, Google Sheets and Tableau were used to evaluate the cleaned data. The study's objectives were tailored to pinpoint potential chances for revenue growth and monitor performance in the areas of web development, graphic design, business finance, and musical instruments.

The provided data shows that Web development courses are the most popular while Musical Instrument courses are the least popular.
Web development courses would generate the highest revenue hence there should be a reduction in free courses while more focus should tend towards paid courses.

The provided data shows that web development is the most popular of all the subjects and also provided the highest revenue. Also, the reduction of free web development courses will further help drive up more revenue.
Given that web development was the main source of most of the revenue, there may be opportunities to further boost revenue.

# THE PROBLEM

The Udemy Data set is to analyze and measure the performance of different courses provided, discover opportunities for additional revenue, and Identify the Top 20 most popular subjects student found interesting. It took me about three (3) weeks to complete the data analyses.

Data in web development, Graphic design, Business Finance, and Musical Instruments will help in providing the necessary information. To facilitate comprehension, the data is presented in tabular, descriptive, and visual formats.

The analysis seeks to enable us to understand the subject with which more courses should be created, know the total number of subscribers in each subject, how the average content duration, price, and the number of students vary across different subjects, The number of free-to-paid courses for each subject, the average price of web development courses at a different level, the subject with the Top 20 most popular courses, and if content duration impacts the price of the courses.

I was also able to answer the 5 why questions as below;

Why are the number of subscribers and price of Musical Instrument courses low?
Why? - Students or subscribers are not mostly interested in the Musical Instrument courses
Why?  - Students or subscribers prefer to subscribe or take Web development courses
Why? - Web Development courses are most sought after in the world today
Why? - Students skilled or certified in Web development tend to be more employed than those skilled or certified in Musical instrument courses.

# THE DESIGN

I was provided with Raw Udemy datasets and was able to clean the data using Filtering and Sorting, Find and Replace, conditional formatting, etc on Google Sheets. Thereafter, I proceeded to analyze the data while using Descriptive statistics to determine the Mean, Median, Minimum, and Maximum of the data, as well as Pivot tables to quickly extract the data in a more preferred dashboard. I also use the Vlookup function to look for specific data vertically across the spreadsheet.

To visualize the data in order to resolve some specific problems, I use Tableau to create meaningful Visuals, Dashboards, and Insights into the Data which were also included in the report. Tableau is best suited to managing large data sets and can provide a more detailed analysis.

# IMPORTANT FINDINDS

Below are the results and findings from the datasets;

I discovered that almost 68% of Totals subscribers and top 5 courses come from Web Development.

Business Finance and web development have almost equal numbers of total courses (1155 vs 1203), but web development courses are almost 2x in content duration and have 4x of the average subscribers.

Web development courses tend to be slightly costlier (30.3%) than Business Finance courses(27.1%), Graphics design (23.1%), and Musical Instruments(19.5%). Also, the price of the course in the intermediate level for web development is more than the Beginner level. The beginner level and All levels have almost equal average prices (78.5 vs 74.6).

Paid courses from all four subjects are much more than the free courses with Graphics Design taking 94% of its paid courses against 6% of its free. Musical Instruments 93.1% paid and 6.9% free, Business Finance 91.7% paid and 8.3% free, and Web development 88.9% paid and 11.3% free. 

# ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

**Product recommendations**

Reduction of free web development while focusing on getting more paid of these courses.

**Marketing recommendations**
Our data show that web development courses are the most popular and people are willing to pay for them. Marketing and advertising campaigns should therefore be tailored in that direction.

# CONCLUSION

The Paperwork has covered the analysis for the Udemy Data Set, where I am hypothetically a Data Analyst required to clean, analyze the visualize the data in order to solve business problems.

By analyzing the data, the pricing and subscriptions for each subject were understood and we could determine the trend and pattern as well as what needed to be done to increase the companyâ€™s revenue.

Web development courses tend to be mostly interested by subscribers hence Marketing and campaigns should be tailored to this direction which will in turn increase the companyâ€™s revenue.

In addition, despite the fact that Web development courses are more costliest than all the other remaining courses, students or subscribers still tend to take them.

Conclusively, the data provided that web development courses are the most popular of all the subjects, subscribers are interested to pay for learning, providing the highest revenue and with opportunities to further boost the revenue.


# CAPSTONE PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Here, I was also challenged with a situation where I happen to be a Data analyst, presenting comprehensive datasets for laptops. I am required to work with the Raw dataset which contains detailed information about the laptops including specifications and features. The data was collected through web scraping and included nearer 990 laptops with 12 columns of data such as Laptop Company, Model, Rating, Review, Processor, RAM size, Storage Display Size, Prize, Manufacturer suggested retail price (MRP).

I investigated the laptop information data sets using Google Sheets, the data was cleaned up of duplicates, blank cells were removed, and inconsistent data was corrected. To build the necessary charts and visuals, Google Sheets and Tableau were used to evaluate the cleaned data. The study's objectives were tailored to understand better the variation in pricing of laptops, the number of ratings, sizes, and reviews, and to identify trends and patterns.

Our data shows us that Apple laptops irrespective of their storage size are mostly expensive, while for Windows laptops MSI laptops with large storage (2 TB SSD) are the most expensive.
Although Lenovo laptops receive more ratings because the brands are mostly sold, but Apple laptops are highly rated with fewer sales. Alternatively, Samsung, Realme, Msi, Asus, and Acer receive slightly higher ratings than the other brands of Windows laptops. Laptops running on 64-bit Windows 11, 8GB RAM, and 512 GB Memory are cost-effective and would increase sales.

# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The Laptop information data set is to analyze and measure the performance of different laptop brands by their specifications and features which include the operating system, Display size, Memory, RAM, and processors. It took me about two (2) weeks to complete the data analyses.

Data about all the laptop brands (Acer, Apple, Asus, Avita, Dell, Gigabyte, Hp, Infinix, Lenovo, LG, Mi, MSI, Nokia, Realme, RedmiBook, Samsung, and Vaio) will help in providing the necessary information. To facilitate comprehension, the data was as well presented in tabular, descriptive, and visual formats.

The analysis seeks to enable us to identify which brand of laptops consumers are majorly interested in, understand the Laptop company that is popular, compare the performance of these laptops based on their specifications and features, know the total ratings and ratings received from each laptop company, how the average manufacturerâ€™s price affects the current price of each laptop, and know the average price for the operating system,  RAM and Memory size for each of the Laptops.

# DESIGN

I was provided with Raw Lapto information from Kaggle. The data was collected through web scraping and included nearer 990 laptops with 12 columns of data such as Laptop Company, Model, Rating, Review, Processor, RAM size, Storage Display Size, Prize, Manufacturer suggested retail price (MRP).

These datasets were cleaned by removing blank cells, duplicated rows or columns, and inconsistent data were removed using Filtering and Sorting, Find and Replace, and conditional formatting on Google Sheets. Thereafter, I proceeded to analyze the data while using Descriptive statistics to determine the Mean, Median, Minimum, and Maximum of the data, as well as Pivot tables to quickly extract the data in a more preferred dashboard. 

To visualize the data in order to resolve some specific problems, I use Tableau to create meaningful Visuals, Dashboards, and Insights into the Data which were also included in the report. Tableau is best suited to managing large data sets and can provide a more detailed analysis.

# UDEMY DATA PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I was challenged with a situation where I happen to be a Data analyst, presenting the data for various Udemy courses. I am required to work with the Raw data and was able to clean, analyze and visualize the data to make business decisions.

I investigated Udemy data sets of subscribers trends in four (4) different subject
areas. Using Google Sheets, the data was cleaned up of duplicates, blank cells
were removed, and inconsistent data was corrected. To build the necessary charts
and visuals, Google Sheets and Tableau were used to evaluate the cleaned data. The
study's objectives were tailored to pinpoint potential chances for revenue growth and
monitor performance in the areas of web development, graphic design, business
finance, and musical instruments.

The provided data shows that Web development courses are the most popular while Musical Instrument courses are the least popular.
Web development courses would generate the highest revenue hence there should be a reduction in free courses while more focus should tend towards paid courses.

The provided data shows that web development is the most popular of all the
subjects and also provided the highest revenue. Also, the reduction of free web development courses will further help drive up more revenue.
Given that web development was the main source of most of the revenue, there
may be opportunities to further boost revenue.

# THE PROBLEM

The Udemy Data set is to analyze and measure the performance of different courses provided, discover opportunities for additional revenue, and Identify the Top 20 most popular subjects student found interesting. It took me about three (3) weeks to complete the data analyses.

Data in web development, Graphic design, Business Finance, and Musical Instruments will help in providing the necessary information. To facilitate comprehension, the data is presented in tabular, descriptive, and visual formats.

The analysis seeks to enable us to understand the subject with which more courses should be created, know the total number of subscribers in each subject, how the average content duration, price, and the number of students vary across different subjects, The number of free-to-paid courses for each subject, the average price of web development courses at a different level, the subject with the Top 20 most popular courses, and if content duration impacts the price of the courses.


I was also able to answer the 5 why questions as below;

Why are the number of subscribers and price of Musical Instrument courses low?
Why? - Students or subscribers are not mostly interested in the Musical Instrument courses
Why?  - Students or subscribers prefer to subscribe or take Web development courses
Why? - Web Development courses are most sought after in the world today
Why? - Students skilled or certified in Web development tend to be more employed than those skilled or certified in Musical instrument courses.
